    <h2 style="color:white">Hey there!</h2>
        
        <p style="color:white">You found yourself to the portfolio of Oona Jakobsson, a developer & designer.<br>
        Let's start by learning a bit about who I am.</p>

    
        <h2 style="color:white">Who am I</h2>
        
          
    <p style="color:white" > My name is Oona and I am woman.
    <br> My dream is creating something new and beautiful and become a smooth coder.<br>
    My intrest in computers started really young. First by playing games,<br>
     to creating presentations on Word and PowerPoint,to social media, <br>
    to wondering how it all works, to creating games, then creating websites with plugins, <br>
    to actually doing it all from scratch by myself.<br>
    I have always been ready to help building things or fixing things, since I was little.<br>
    I enjoy being a part of projects and seeing the results of that. </p>
    <p style="color:white">
        I am a mother of three beautiful children &#x1F496;	 <br>
        Family has always been very important to me, but work aswell.<br>
         I believe in balance in everything I do and everything I am. <br>
         I like to think outside of the box and find new point of views.<br>
         I am definetely a dreamer and I believe the future belongs to those, who believe in their dreams.<br>
         Also what I think is worth mentioning, is my love for apes and monkeys, chimpanzees especially.<br>
         It's something that everyone who knows me, knows.&#x1F604;<br>
        So anything with apes, I'm down for it!&#x1F412;<br>
        Workwised, right now, my intrests lands in creating apps and websites.
